   This may be a mist
ake.

   As of Next.js 16 T
urbopack is enabled b
y default and
   custom webpack con
figurations may need 
to be migrated to Tur
bopack.

   NOTE: your `webpac
k` config may have be
en added by a configu
ration plugin.

   To configure Turbo
pack, see https://nex
tjs.org/docs/app/api-
reference/next-config
-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applicat
ions work fine under 
Turbopack with no con
figuration,
   if that is the cas
e for you, you can si
lence this error by p
assing the
   `--turbopack` or `
--webpack` flag expli
citly or simply setti
ng an 
   empty turbopack co
nfig in your Next con
fig file (e.g. `turbo
pack: {}`).
